# Medical Diagnosis System

This project is a medical diagnosis system designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing various medical conditions. It utilizes machine learning algorithms and medical knowledge to provide accurate diagnoses based on patient symptoms and medical history.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is educational. It serves as a learning tool for understanding the implementation of machine learning techniques in healthcare, specifically in medical diagnosis. 

## Features

- **Symptom Analysis**: The system analyzes patient symptoms and  suggest possible diagnoses.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as DescisionTrees and RandomForests to improve diagnostic accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface for healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive diagnoses.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/saichiranthan/medical-diagnosis-system.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r "modules in readme.txt"`
3. Run the application: `python DescisionTree model.py ----for descisiontree method and RandomForest model.py for randomforest method`

## Usage

1. Input patient symptoms  into the system.
2. Click on the "Diagnose" button to obtain possible diagnoses.
3. Review the suggested diagnoses and consult with healthcare professionals for further evaluation.
